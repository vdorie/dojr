obts,OBTS Main Database,obts_clean.Rdata,obts,1,1,1,,"The Offender Based Transaction Statistics database is an extract of California's Automated Criminal History System (ACHS), which is used, among other things, for background checks. The OBTS is intended to capture the arrest cycle for all felonies in ACHS, beginning with arrest and ending with a release, a decline to prosecute, a not guilty verdict, or a guilty verdict and a sentence. OBTS data begins in 1982 and contains 250,000 to 400,000 records per year. Each record includes the arresting officer's jurisdiction, the arrest date and BCS code for offense, the age/birth date of the arrestee, the arrestee's demographics, and, if applicable, charges pressed, charges convicted, and sentence type. The OBTS also contains direct identifiers such as name, CII, and DoB. "
