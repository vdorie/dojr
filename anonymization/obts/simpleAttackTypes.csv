match on demographic quasi-identifiers for specific group,sensitive criminal justice values are homogeneous for demographic quasi-identifiers,enforce $l$-diversity for sensitive values by suppressing county

match on demographic quasi-identifiers for specific group,sensitive values are near homogeneous for quasi-identifiers and all of a similar severity,"\textcolor{red}{[EG: could enforce $l$-diversity = 2 on offense level?] [VD: since they're all felonies, we'd have to somehow group them by severity]}"
