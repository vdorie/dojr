"match on quasi-identifiers for specific individual",quasi-identifier key is unique/rare,enforce $k$-anonymity for quasi-identifiers by binning and suppression
match on quasi-identifiers for specific group,sensitive values are homogeneous for quasi-identifiers,enforce $l$-diversity for sensitive values from quasi-identifiers by suppression
match on partial quasi-identifiers and partial sensitive values for unknown individual,quasi-identifiers are homogeneous for certain sensitive values,"enforce $l$-diversity for quasi-identifiers from specific, knowable sensitive values"
match on complete quasi-identifiers and partial sensitive values for a known individual,sensitive values are homogeneous for combination of quasi-identifiers and known sensitive values,"enforce $l$-diversity for combination of quasi-identifiers and knowable sensitive values on unknowable ones"
match on demographic quasi-identifiers for specific group,sensitive values are near homogeneous for quasi-identifiers and all of a similar severity,"break crimes into violent-not violent; enforce $l$-diversity on that categorization"
