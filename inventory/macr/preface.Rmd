# Abstract

The Monthly Arrest and Citations Record (MACR) database describes arrests in California from 1980 to the present. Each row includes the race, age, and gender of the individual arrested, the most serious offense for which he or she was arrested, the year of the arrest, and the county in which the arrest took place. This version of the data only contains arrests of adults (18+).
